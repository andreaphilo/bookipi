to parse the billingPeriod attribute into start and end dates, you can just update the extract_data_mongo part then edit the subscription_payment.py script with the new one.
the new file will be in on part 2 folder.
then just push the updated script into the repository of warehouse script.
so it will be adjusted without risking other pipelines.
